            <h2>Flowers have a wide variety of colors, scents, shapes and types of flowers, which have different classification criteria.</h2>
            <h3>Flowers can be classified into different types based on the following criteria: Types of flowers</h3>
            <p>1. Classified according to the structure of the stigma layer in flowers, it can be divided into 2 types:</p>
            <p> * Perfect Flower is a flower that has both male and female stamens in the same flower, such as hibiscus, peas, chili, canna, rice, lotus, bougainvillea, and eggplant.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p> * Imperfect Flower is a flower that has only one sex. In a single flower, there will be only one sex. This makes these plants have flowers that are divided into male flowers (Staminate Flower) and female flowers (Pistillate Flower) , such as ivy gourd, corn, pumpkin , and cucumber.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>2. Classified according to the structural components of the flower, it can be divided into 2 types:</p>
            <p> * Complete Flower is a flower that has all four layers of structure in one flower, including the calyx layer, the corolla layer, the stamen layer , and the pistil layer, such as those found in hibiscus , roses, cassia, eggplant, and jasmine.</p>

            <p> * Incomplete Flower means a flower that is incomplete or a flower that has all 4 layers of components that are not complete in a single flower, by missing any part, such as the evening primrose that lacks the petal layer, the anthurium and the phalaenopsis that lack the sepals and petals, including the ivy gourd, pumpkin, squash and melon that lack the stamen or pistil layer, etc.</p>

            <p>In addition, some flowers that are perfect flowers because they have both male and female stamens may be classified as incomplete flowers because they are missing a component of one of the layers. Therefore, in the case that the flower is incomplete, it may require additional consideration because it may be both perfect and imperfect flowers, similar to perfect flowers that may be both complete and incomplete flowers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>3. Classified by the number of flowers on the flower stalk, it can be divided into 2 types:</p>

            <h2>How to store and care for flowers to keep them fresh for a long time</h2>
            <h3>When we take a bouquet or fresh flowers to take a photo to keep as a memory, we must find a way to make the flowers stay fresh for a long time. And here are 4 easy steps that should be done every time to take care of fresh flowers so that they last with us for a long time.</h3>
            <p>Step 1: Cut the stem at a 45 degree angle.</p>
            <p>First of all, prepare a vase or any container in the house with a wide mouth and clean it. Do not choose a vase that is too small because it will cause the flower stems to be crushed and not be able to absorb water to nourish the flowers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="imge">
            <img src="images/c1.webp" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p> Step 2: Trim off rotten leaves.</p>
            <p>If we are happily looking at flowers and we come across a withered, rotten or rotting part, do not leave it with regret, but quickly cut it off. Otherwise, the rotten part will release ethylene gas, and this gas can cause the fresh flowers around it to wilt as well.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="imge">
            <img src="images/c2.webp" alt="Imperfect Flower">
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Step 3: Keep away from risk factors.</p>
            <p>Recommended for those who want to have a beautiful vase corner. We should know first that we should not place flowers near risk factors that will cause the flowers to wilt, which is not to expose them to direct sunlight, closed areas with high temperatures, including placing them near fruits because fruits release ethylene gas, causing the flowers to wilt faster than normal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="imge">
            <img src="images/c3.webp" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Step 4: Change the water daily.</p>
            <p>Just changing the water in the vase every day will make the flowers stay fresh longer. And every time we change the water, don't forget to clean all the stains in the vase and on the flower stems thoroughly before refilling with new water. Because cleaning the vase first will reduce the risk of infection, resulting in the flowers staying fresh longer.</p>
